CHR = {1..22}, X
POP = {CHB,CHS,JPT}


1. snp/chr-CHR.snp.gz
list of SNPs  (1 per row) used to call Neandertal ancestry
columns:
1: snp id 
2: chromosome
3: genetic position
4: physical position (hg19,1-based coords)
5: derived allele
6: ancestral allele

2. ids/POP.ids, ids/POP.chr-X.ids
1kg individual ids (one per haploid genome) 


3. POP.hapmap/summaries/chr-CHR.thresh-90.length-0.00.gz
one line  per snp. contains summaries of the files in 2.
most relevant columns:
col 1  : snp id (chr:physical position)
col 11 : average marginal probability of neandertal ancestry
col 15 :  number of alleles at the SNP that have neandertal ancestry >=0.9
detailed description of cols in the header for each file


4. POP.hapmap/summaries/haplotypes/chr-CHR.thresh-90.length-0.00.haplotypes
one line per haplotype (runs of SNPs with probability >0.90)
col 1: chr
col 2: haploid individual number (indexed from 0, refers to haploid individual in file ids/POP.ids )
col 3: start pos 
col 4: end pos
col 5: physical length
col 6: genetic length
col 7: average predicted probability
col 8: ignore
col 9: number of snps 

5. EUR-ASN.hapmap/summaries/contigs/contigs.all
tiling path of confident Neandertal haplotypes using all EUR-ASN populations
col 1: chr
col 2: start pos
col 3: end pos
