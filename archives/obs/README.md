This directory contains the observed values of the genetic summary statistics calculated in previous studies for empirical genetic data.
Details about the publications from which the values were retrieved are found in the files (as comments) and in Supplementary Materials of Tournebize & Chikhi (2023).

Population labels (cf. [1KG](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/population)):

- CEU = Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry
- YRI = Yoruba
- Vindija = Vindija33.19

Note that for the S' and the CRF analyses, we used the analyzed data from the original studies, that we further summarized using a custom script which is located in [`archives/obs/estimation/estimation.py`](https://github.com/sunyatin/qna/blob/main/archives/obs/estimation/estimation.py).
