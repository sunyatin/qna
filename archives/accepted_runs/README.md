This directory contains full information about the twenty accepted runs of our structured model introduced in Tournebize & Chikhi (2023).

The `model_plots` directory contains the visual representation of the runs (in SVG format), obtained using the [`demesdraw`](https://github.com/grahamgower/demesdraw) python library.

The `par_yaml` directory contains, for each run:
- a `*.par` file, which is our custom encoding of the demographic model, interpretable by the [`simulate.py`](https://github.com/sunyatin/qna/blob/main/scripts/simulate.py) script.
- a `*.demo` file, which is the print of the `msprime` history generated by the [`.debug()`](https://tskit.dev/msprime/docs/latest/api.html) function of DemographyDebugger class.
- a `*.yaml` file, which is the demographic history in the [`demes`](https://popsim-consortium.github.io/demes-spec-docs/main/introduction.html) format.
